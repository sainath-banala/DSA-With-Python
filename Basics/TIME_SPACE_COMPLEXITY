# time complexity refers to the time increase rate with the increase in the input size
--> time complexity will be measured using Big O Notation - O()
--> While computing time complexity, we will  consider these three points:
    --> Always consider the worst case
    --> Ignore the constants
    --> Ignore the lower values


# space complexity refers to the Auxilary space + input space
--> where auxilary space is the space that we used to solve the problem
--> input space is the storage that to store the 
Ex:
---
a=10, b=20
c = a + b 

here c is the auxilary space, and a, b are the input space
